**About**

We have created this plugin out of personal need to have quick access to list of upcoming WordCamps right from the wp-admin. Plugin displays a widget on dashboard containing the list of upcoming WordCamps with options to search, sort & navigate through list along with direct link to respective wordcamp website. Data is fetched using JSON API (from https://central.wordcamp.org/wp-json/posts?type=wordcamp) and stored in transient for better performance, which is refreshed every day to reflect new data.

 1. Option to refresh data
 2. Re-write plugin code
 3. Improve data fetching
 4. <del >Creating shortcode to display wordcamp list anywhere on website front-end</de>
 5. Option to filter WordCamps based on users location/country
 6. localization
